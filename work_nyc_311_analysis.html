            <p align="justify">The NYC 311 Service Requests Analysis project aims to delve into the rich dataset
              provided by New York City's 311 system to uncover valuable insights and trends related to various service
              requests made by residents and visitors.<br>
              The NYC 311 system serves as a central hub for individuals to report non-emergency issues, request
              information, and seek assistance from the city's agencies. <br>
              This analysis will involve collecting and analyzing a vast array of service request data, including the
              type of request, location, time of submission, agency response time, and resolution status. By applying
              data mining, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques,
              I will uncover patterns, anomalies, and trends that can provide a deeper understanding of the city's urban
              challenges, public service effectiveness, and community needs.

          <p align="justify">
            It could be seen that, for numerical atrributes: <font color="#d6ecaa"><strong>School or Citywide Complaint,

            </font> are all missing values with their count of row equals to 0 and all
            other statistical value are NaN.
            Hence, we should dropna for these 5 columns.<br>
            Moreover, for object attributes, it looks like there are many incomplete columns and some columns have only
            1 unique value, which may not be very informative and useful.<br>

          <p align="justify">We could see many columns are filled with NaN.
            Somes even fill with 100% null values like: <font color="#d6ecaa"><strong>Road Ramp, Ferry Direction,
                Verhicle Type, ..</strong></font>.<br>
            Which ones we should replace and which ones we should drop it? <br>
            Let's see its weight on the whole dataset.

          <p align="justify">
            We will drop columns with greater then >10% null percentage => obj + numberic columns = 18 columns will be
            dropped.<br>
            Since we have 4 columns indicated the position of incident on map, which are lat/long and x/y coordinate.
            <br>
            I would refer to use lat/long so I will drop these 2 x/y coordinate columns as well as location column
            (which contains the paired of lat/long).
            And I also don't need the Incident Zip. <br>
            Below is the remain columns which still contain NaN values and their "missing value relationship".

            I will fill the null with <strong>"Unspecified"</strong>. <br>
            For <font color="#d6ecaa"><strong>Longitude - Latitude</strong></font>, since the dataset is all centered in
            NYC. I will replace null value with the mode.

          <p align="justify">
            We could see that all the columns start with <strong>"School"</strong> have the top is unspecified. And the
            <font color="#d6ecaa"><strong>School Not Found</strong></font> has only 1 value is 'N' which is not
            informative. <br>
            Also, the complaint type <strong>Ferry Complaint</strong> has no Due Date and Closed Date and 1 missing
            Value on Resolution Action Updated Date,
            which is not informative too. <br>
            Hence, we will drop all these columns for school and all these rows that related to Ferry Complaint.
          </p>
          <img src="./assets/images/nyc_311/date_column.png" class="img-responsive">
          <p align="justify">
            Hold on! It looks like we have date-type columns, before cleaning these columns, let's convert its
            object-type to datetime.

          <img src="./assets/images/nyc_311/dataset_info.png" class="img-responsive">
          <p align="justify">Perfect! <br>
            The <font color="#d6ecaa"><strong>Due Date</strong></font> column is missing only 1 observation. Let's take
            a look on it.
          </p>
          <img src="./assets/images/nyc_311/duedate_missing.png" class="img-responsive">
          <p align="justify">
            For the remain row of <font color="#d6ecaa"><strong>Due Date</strong></font> is NaT and
            <font color="#d6ecaa"><strong>Resolution Action Updated Date</strong></font> is NaT. We could see that the
            <font color="#d6ecaa"><strong>Closed Date</strong></font> is same day with the <font color="#d6ecaa">
              <strong>Created Date</strong>
            </font>.<br>
            So I will fill NaT for <font color="#d6ecaa"><strong>Due Date</strong></font> and <font color="#d6ecaa">
              <strong>Resolution Action Updated Date</strong>
            </font> with the same value as <font color="#d6ecaa">
              <strong>Closed Date</strong>

          <img src="./assets/images/nyc_311/closed_date.png" class="img-responsive">
          <p align="justify">
            We could seen that some <font color="#d6ecaa"><strong>Closed Date</strong></font> observation are NaT
            because their <font color="#d6ecaa"><strong>Status</strong></font> haven't closed yet. So there is no
            problem with this column. <br>
            But the <strong>"Draft"</strong> status seems to be useless so I will drop that row. <br>
            For the <font color="#d6ecaa"><strong>Resolution Action Updated Date</strong></font>, I have performed some
            investigation.<br>
            So here is the findings and my solution:<br>
            <li align="justify">The <font color="#d6ecaa"><strong>Resolution Action Updated Date</strong></font> was
              missing for closed status (2 rows only).
              But there were closed date already so I will replace these missings with its closed-date.</li>
            <li align="justify">The <strong>'Your complaint has been forwarded to the New York Police Department for a

              solution has 100% null values for <font color="#d6ecaa"><strong>Resolution Action Updated Date</strong>

              <strong>==></strong> For these 2 <font color="#d6ecaa"><strong>Resolution Descriptor</strong></font>, we

            In a concise overview, the <strong>majority (60.2%)</strong> of reported issues stem from the neighborhoods of BROOKLYN and QUEENS.<br>
            The prevailing concerns appear to revolve around cases of Blocked Driveways and Illegal Parking.<br>
            Interestingly, these two complaint types stand out as the most common across BRONX, BROOKLYN, QUEENS, and STATEN ISLAND, 
            drawing the highest number of tickets issued by the NYPD. <br>
            However, when we shift our attention to MANHATTAN, a distinct pattern emerges. This borough faces a distinctive challenge with Noise problems, with the primary culprits being Noise complaints originating from Street/Sidewalk disturbances and Commercial events. <br>
            It's noteworthy that MANHATTAN's top two issues both relate to noise, setting it apart from the other boroughs. MANHATTAN government should take an eye on this.

            equivalent to around 336 hours.<br>
            However, it's worth noting that the two complaint types that demand the most extended period for resolution are Noise - Street/Sidewalk and Noise - Commercial.

            Since May 2015, there has been a noticeable uptick in the number of complaints, primarily attributed to Noise - Street/Sidewalk issues. <br>
            Interestingly, during the same period, the frequency of Blocked Driveway complaints experienced a decline from May through the end of September.

            One can readily observe that the count of complaints initiated experiences a gradual rise from 5 A.M., 
            peaking around midnight.<br>
            This trend suggests a consistent increase in complaint creation throughout the day, with the highest numbers recorded during the late hours.

            Notably, both Saturday and Sunday witness a rise in Noise complaints stemming from Commercial and Street/Sidewalk sources. 
            This pattern can likely be attributed to the surge in social activities that typically unfold during the weekends.

            An interesting insight from the map analysis is that distinct issue patterns seem to emerge based on varying geographical ranges.<br>
            It becomes evident that the same type of issue tends to recur within specific areas,
            implying that different locales don't encounter identical problems universally.<br>
            This discrepancy could potentially be attributed to the unique urban dynamics, borough characteristics, street cultures, and inherent behavioral patterns across the city.

            Upon examining the plotted map, a distinct observation comes to light: Unspecified data points are notably clustered
            within the BRONX region. <br>
            What's intriguing is that a significant portion of these data points correspond to Noise-related issues and instances
            of illegal parking, fewer is about Derelict Vehicle and Vending.
